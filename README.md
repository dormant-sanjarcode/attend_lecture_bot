## What
A bot (üòÇÔ∏è bunch of scripts) that attends lectures on Google Meet.

## Why

This as a prank projectü§óÔ∏è.

## How
- It uses the `cron` daemon to fire a script, as per your timetable.
- Opens Chrome, logs in using given credentials.
- Closes the browser, after a specified time(for example 60 minutes).
- Logs in the status, errors that occurred in a file for future reference.
